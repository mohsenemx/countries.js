# List of Engines supported by Country.js's RandomName API:
## CRLE
**Completely Random Letter Engine** or **CRLE** for short, will recieve a seed and generate a Completely radnom word based on the seed.
## NSRE
**Not So Random Engine** or **NSRE** is less random than CRLE, it doesn't require a seed, you can pass False as seed if you're using NSRE. 
NSRE is the default.
## RSWSE
**Random Seeded Word Scraper Engine** or **RSWSE** for short, will be coming soon and isn't available right now.
