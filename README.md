# countries.js

I'm too lazy to write documentation, figure it out by yourself, like a chad programmer :)

## Documentation
You can check docs folder.
## Prerequisites
These are things you need to understand before you can use Countries.js:
1. Basic knowledge of Javascript (Web/Node.js)
2. How to work with Objects and JSON
3. How to work with Arrays (Indexes and etc...)
4. How functions Work (Passing Variables)
These are tools you need to have to start using Countries.js:
1. A browser / Node.js
2. A code editor (You can also use Notepad)
3. A device that can run code (Computers,Gaming Consoles,Phones,Smart Fridges and etc...)
## Development Progress
I think we'll be done around June 2023?
